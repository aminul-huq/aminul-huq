### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently doing my Master's at Tsinghua University, China at the dept. of Computer Science and Technology.  I did my Bachelor's from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh. 

My research interest lies in Adversarial Machine Learning. Currently, I am working on defense techniques for Deep Learning models from Adversarial Examples.

I like to read books, travel, watch cartoons and anime and explore interesting food.
